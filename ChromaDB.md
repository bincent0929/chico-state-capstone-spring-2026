According to [here](https://docs.trychroma.com/docs/overview/getting-started) ChromaDB will allow me to create a smaller set of data that I can feed an LLM through creating a vector database of the text data I feed into it based on queries I give it.

I would go data -> chromaDB -> LangChain Agent -> LLM.
